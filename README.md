# Low Fidelity Prototype 
## Laudan Hosseini, DH110-05

## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of developing this low fidelity prototype is to refine and enhance certain features of the online reading platform, Audiobooks HQ. The prototype will be tested in order to gauge if the refinements are successul in improving usability for the target audience. 
### User Personas 
The personas that will be our target audience for this testing consist of senior citizens (age 55+) who enjoy reading as a hobby, for personal development, or for teaching purposes. This group will most likely have had an education at least up until high school and most likely attended college as well. Some of these users will have professions within education and/or research, making reading a necessity for their workplace. Other users could utilize reading for their own educational development or purely for leisure/relaxation.  
### Features + Tasks 
The features that we have decide to target for points of improvement were identified through usability testing of the application, contextual inquiry on performing tasks within the application, and initial reactions that I personally had when working with the application. The two features are (1) developing a more prominent, organized, and advanced search bar and (2) creating a more structured and interactive organization section for the user's downloaded readings.  

## Wireframes
### Wireframe 1: Homepage right when you click to enter the application

### Wireframe 2: Search page when you begin to look for different Audiobooks (gives you multiple bookstores)

### Wireframe 3: Search bar that further organizes which type of audiobook you are looking for

## Wireflows 
### Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar 
![Task 1_Navigating the Seach Bar.jpg](https://github.com/laudanhosseini/DH110-05/blob/f6225df544f14d5494678695b599ff7ad613fd7e/Task%201_%20Navigating%20the%20Search%20Bar.jpg)

### Description: 
This task is modelled around trying to get the user to navigate the search bar. This is to see how advanced the search bar can filter out certain settings and to see how quickly one is able to find the audiobook he/she/they is looking for. 
  
  **Flow + Features:** The user would start out at the homepage, which displays the audiobooks the user has already purchased/downloaded. To get to the  search bar, the user would have to click either the little **book button** in the top left corner OR the **big plus sign** at the bottom of the page. This takes us to the second wireframe, which is of the audiobook stores the user can choose from. The stores range from the main search engine to free audiobooks to radio shows. Once the user chooses which store is desired, this takes us to the last wireframe, which is the actual search engine. Here, the user can filter out the searches based on a variety of filters, such as languages, ratings, or genres. If the user wants a more advanced search, they click the **"More"** button, which allows them to search solely by author or title. 

### Prototype for Task 1 
   **(Did not want to be VideoTaped, so took notes of the users' actions instead)**

### Confusions: 
The user first clicked on the little book button to get to the search engine instead of the big plus sign, most likely because the user initially looked at the top of the page for search bars (that is where they are usually located). However, this initial step took the user a while because it was in the top left corner, where usually these are found in the top *right* corner. Another point of confusion was when the user got to the second page, as she paused for a while not knowing what to do next. She clicked on the **home** button and then the **heart button (favorites)**, but found no luck. After a minute or so she realized that these are the audiobook stores that she can search from, so she clicked the first one and had no trouble navigating the actual search engine. Although, she did note that she would have liked an organization based on prices included as well. 

### Task 2: Organization of Content

### Description: 
This task is modelled around seeing the organization of content on this application and if there is a more structured, interactive way that the users' content can be organized. 
    
   **Flow + Features:** The user begins again at the homepage, which already displays the downloaded/purchased content. From here, the user can navigate the organization by looking at their content based on **Title, Author, or Recent.** If the user wants to see their **Favorites**, the user has to go to the audiobook store section to find the **heart icon**, symbolizing favorites.

### Confusions: 
The user seemed pretty knowledgable about how to navigate the organization of content located on the homepage, but when it came to finding the favorites section, the user was very confused. I had to give her a hint about going to the search engine to find the favorites, and she noted that this was a very odd organization; she would have preferred if there was another tab on the homepage labelled **Favorites** instead. That was the main point of confusion with this task. However, the user also noted that she would have liked a more distinct homepage with a tab that says **My Books**, and from clicking this, there can be different tabs for organization, such as title, author, recents, favorites, genres, purpose, price, etc. She also noted that it would be a cool interactive feature to allow the user to create his/her/their own tabs with unique labels.
