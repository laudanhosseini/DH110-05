# Low Fidelity Prototype 
## Laudan Hosseini, DH110-05

## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of developing this low fidelity prototype is to refine and enhance certain features of the online reading platform, Audiobooks HQ. The prototype will be tested in order to gauge if the refinements are successul in improving usability for the target audience. 
### User Personas 
The personas that will be our target audience for this testing consist of senior citizens (age 55+) who enjoy reading as a hobby, for personal development, or for teaching purposes. This group will most likely have had an education at least up until high school and most likely attended college as well. Some of these users will have professions within education and/or research, making reading a necessity for their workplace. Other users could utilize reading for their own educational development or purely for leisure/relaxation.  
### Features + Tasks 
The features that we have decide to target for points of improvement were identified through usability testing of the application, contextual inquiry on performing tasks within the application, and initial reactions that I personally had when working with the application. The two features are (1) developing a more prominent, organized, and advanced search bar and (2) creating a more structured and interactive organization section for the user's downloaded readings.
